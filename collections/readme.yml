# DOC: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections_guide/collections_installing.html#install-multiple-collections-with-a-requirements-file
# Rename this file to requirements.yml in order to install required collections into ansible environment. This content could be placed instead in collections: section from meta/main.yml
# of each individual role.
# A very simple example:
# collections:
#   - ansible.netcommon
#   - ansible.utils
